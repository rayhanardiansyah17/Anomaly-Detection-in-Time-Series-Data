# **Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data**

Detect anomalies in time-series data using Isolation Forest. This project can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as detecting spikes in web traffic or unusual user behavior.

**Key Techniques**: Isolation Forest, Data Visualization (Matplotlib)

**Highlights:**

1. Identifies outliers in noisy data.
2. Visualizes anomalies on a time series graph.

**Dataset**: Simulated time-series data.
