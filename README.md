# **Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data**

Detect anomalies in time-series data using Isolation Forest. This project can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as detecting spikes in web traffic or unusual user behavior.

Key Techniques: Isolation Forest, Data Visualization (Matplotlib)

Highlights:

Identifies outliers in noisy data.

Visualizes anomalies on a time series graph.

Dataset: Simulated time-series data.
